# SplitAnything

SplitAnything is a flexible tool designed to help you classify or cluster any type of 2D matrix data using Jupyter Notebooks. It works with unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised learning. The main goals of this tool are:

1. To offer all the needed methods in each step for a hands-on experience.
2. To explain what's going on, so you can understand the process.
3. To help you pick the best model for your data.

## How to use this pipeline?

1. Clone this project into your local project folder.
2. Work on the Jupyter notebooks in order according to your purpose (unsupervised, supervised, or semi-supervised learning).
3. Follow the instruction and explanation step by step for exploring your data.
4. Wrap all the analyses into a HTML report by running `bash render_reports.sh`.

## Configure the environment
```bash
conda env create -n SplitAnything -f conda_environment.yml
